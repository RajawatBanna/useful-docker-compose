## ‚ú®Prerequisites

- Make sure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
  - Windows or macOS:
    [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
  - Linux: [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and then
    [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)
- Download some or all of the samples from this repository.

### Running a sample

The root directory of each sample contains the `docker-compose.yaml` which
describes the configuration of service components.

Check the `README.md` of each sample to get more details on the structure and what is the expected output.

All samples can be run in a local environment by going into the root directory of each one and executing:

```console
docker-compose up
```

To Run in dettached mode use -d flag

```console
docker-compose up -d
```

If you don't want to run all the containers but some, do the following:

```console 
docker-compose up -d service1 service2
```


To stop and remove all containers of the sample application run:

```console
docker-compose down
```

To stop and remove all containers with Volume of the sample application run:

```console
docker-compose down -v
```

## ‚ú® Requirements
- Docker Compose


## üéì Usage

- Example config files are usually provided but not yet located in the correct volume bind mount paths. Adjust!

Otherwise, it should be a matter of:
````
git clone https://github.com/RajawatBanna/useful-docker-compose && cd useful-docker-compose
cd <container-of-interest>

# read the notes, comments and adjust compose + volumes + configs
docker compose up
````

> **Note**:
> The samples are intended for use in local development environments such as project setups, tinkering with software stacks, etc. These samples may be deployed in production environments or exposed to the Internet but please adhere to general hardening and security guidelines. Adjust all default credentials, implement a backup process and have a tested disaster recovery plan. Use a reverse proxy to stream-line your web service exposure and provide an encrypted HTTPS communication channel with trusted SSL certificates.
